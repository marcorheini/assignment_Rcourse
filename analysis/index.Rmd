Welcome to my research website.






## Preparation

```{r}
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Assignment

#### 7. Use the hfi dataset from the `openintro` package
```{r}
data(hfi)
# we will use only the data from 2016 to avoid problems
hfi_2016 <- hfi %>% filter(year=='2016')
```

#### 8. Fit a new model that uses  `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, or the total human freedom score.
```{r}
# fit the model
Q8 <- lm(hf_score~pf_expression_control, data=hfi_2016)
```

#### 9. Again add region to the model from Q4. Compare the slope and $R^2$ with the model from Q4.

```{r}
# define a function that views the most important information
view_param <- function(models){
  sapply(models, function(x){
    c(x$coefficients[2] %>% round(3), # slope
      summary(x)$r.squared %>% round(3), # r_squared
      summary(x)$coefficients[2,4] %>% formatC(digits = 2) # p-value
    )  %>% 
      set_names(nm=c('slope', 'r_squared', 'p_value')) 
  }) %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>%
    set_names(nm=paste0('m', c(1:length(models))))
}
# the model from Q4 was to predict the total score by using the variable ef_money
Q4 <- lm(hf_score~ef_money, data=hfi_2016)
# fit the new models containing the region as exposure
Q9 <- lm(hf_score~ef_money + region, data=hfi_2016)
#view most important information
view_param(list(Q4, Q9))
```


The slope decreased for the model that includes the "region" while the $R^2$ value increased 


#### 10. Finally fit a model with `ef_money` and `pf_expression_control` as exposures and `hf_score` as outcome.  Compare the slope and $R^2$ from the models from Q1. Could `ef_money` be a confounder? 

```{r}
# fit the model
Q10 <- lm(hf_score~ef_money + pf_expression_control, data=hfi_2016)
#view most important information
view_param(list(Q8, Q10))
```


Since we can see that the $R^2$ value increases when both variables are included, but this increase is not very strong, we can assume that the addition of ef_money does not explain much more variance, and thus it might be the case that ef_money is a confounder of pf_expression_control.



#### 11. Use a linear regression model (and scatter plot) with  `ef_money` as exposure and `pf_expression_control` as outcome, to study whether `ef_money` has an association with `pf_expression_control` as well. This might validate our finding that `ef_money` is a confounder between  `pf_expression_control` as exposure and 
`hf_score` as outcome from Q6.


```{r}
# fit the model
Q11 <- lm(pf_expression_control~ef_money, data=hfi_2016)
# plot the results 
ggplot(hfi_2016, aes(x=ef_money, 
                 y=pf_expression_control))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=F)+
  ggtitle(label = 'Association of pf_expression control and ef_money')+
  geom_text(inherit.aes=FALSE, 
            x=2.5, 
            y=8, 
            label=paste(rownames(view_param(list(Q11))),
                        view_param(list(Q11))[[1]],
                        sep=': ')%>% paste(., collapse = '\n'))



```

The slope indicates a positive correlation between the two variables. This correlation is highly significant according to the resulting p-value. Thus, the null hypothesis, which states that there is no relationship between the two variables, can be rejected. What means that the variables ef_money and pf_expression_control are most likely confounders and should not be used together for the prediction of the total human freedom score.
